Game Title:

Connect-4

This is a two player game consisting of Yellow and Red, with Yellow acting as the home player. The way the game works is that each player switches off inserting a coin and the first player to Connect-4, in any direction, WINS. Once the game ends, the board will reset once the user clicks, "Play Again".
